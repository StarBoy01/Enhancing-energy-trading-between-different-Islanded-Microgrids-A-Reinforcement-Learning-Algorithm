# Microgrid Trading Using Reinforcement Learning
 This code is for a paper presented at ICCCEEE20 available at IEEEXPLORE titled Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Enhancing Energy Trading in Microgrids
 
 The paper presents an algorithm that acts as a trading controller for islanded microgrids, applied to data from Sudanese villages. The paper uses two Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, DDPG and PPO on the environment designed by the researchers
